AnaCypher Language Processing is a software company that was set up in 2005 in order to meet the challenge of making computers understand and use human languages. The primary focus of development is an NLP engine which will be used to power a range of applications.

We believe that the key to cutting-edge language technology is to adopt an interdisciplinary approach. By combining insights from different fields, we can achieve sophisticated NLP software. Our goal is to enable computers to process spoken and written knowledge, empowering users to cope with the world's growing information mass â€” in their own language.
