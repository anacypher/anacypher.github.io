AnaCypher Language Processing is a software company that was set up in 2005 in order to meet the challenge of making computers understand and use human languages. The primary focus of development was an NLP engine that would power a range of applications.

The company is currently inactive, but there are plans to organize a think tank on humanist computing around the ideas and technology the company is based on in the near future. Central to these ideas is the vision of a more human-adapted computing environment, especially in terms of natural language.

Thus an important goal is to enable computers to process spoken and written knowledge, empowering users to cope with the world's growing information mass â€” in their own language. The key to cutting-edge language technology is most likely to be found in an interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from different fields such as statistics, linguistics, philosophy and computer science.

The company's founders are Kristoffer Aarholt and [Ivo Spira](http://ivospira.github.io).
