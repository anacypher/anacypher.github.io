In programming computers to master human languages we aim to

1. Express content (information) in the form (language, medium and format) of the user’s choice
2. Provide intuitive, language-based interfaces between human users and computers
3. Enable computers to process human meanings and intentions

From the above statement one can see that our motivation has several aspects:

There is an obvious practical and economical aspect, which is all about saving people the huge effort put into the tedious (but not trivial) tasks of search, translation and summarization every day. Then there is a strong social aspect, since the form and availability of information, as well as control of technology, is essential in order to narrow the digital divide and achieve effective digital governance. And we have a clear technological and scientific aspect, in as far as the machine processability of content opens up new possibilities in the development of artificial intelligence and research on language and thought.

Imagine a world where you talk to the computer in your own language, instead of learning the computer’s “language”. Developing the technology to make this possible is fascinating. We are committed to continuous R&D alongside active application development. We enrich computing with human language; we do the processing, and you are free to be creative and productive.
